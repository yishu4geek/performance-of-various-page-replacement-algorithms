The run.sh file compiles all the java source files, takes the file input.txt as sample file and produces an output.txt
To compile the source files, go to the source folder and run the following command from the command line

./run.sh

The above command generates the output for FIFO algorithm. If you want to run a different algorithm, change the algorithm name in input.txt (present in this folder) and run the above command again. The allowed values of algorithm name are FIFO, LRU or CLOCK
